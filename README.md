# Algorithm Challenge #50 – Custom Square Root Function (Final Challenge)

🧮 Challenge Overview  
-
This final challenge in the series implements a **custom square root calculation**
using mathematical principles and compares it with the built-in `sqrt()` function in C++.

The square root of a number is defined as the value that, when multiplied by itself,
returns the original number. Mathematically, this can be expressed as raising
the number to the power of 0.5.

📐 Square Root Logic
-
- √x = x ^ 0.5
- The algorithm uses the `pow()` function to compute the square root
- Results are validated by comparing them with `sqrt()` from the C++ standard library

Examples:
-
- √25 → 5  
- √16 → 4  
- √2  → 1.4142
